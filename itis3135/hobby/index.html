                <p>Video games are something I spend a lot of time doing. I have always found them enjoyable, immersive,

                    never tiring. This site will provide a brief overview on my hobby of video games.

            <article>
                <p>Video games are a very popular passtime for many people accross the world. Video games come in all
                    shapes and
                    sizes, ranging from consoles, to mobile devices, to laptops, to desktops. I find them to be
                    extremely enjoyable and a great way to spend my time
                    when I have little else to do or work on. I have spent a lot of my life enjoying video games, and
                    hope to continue to do so!

                <p>It is clear that video games as a hobby are becoming more and more popular with one indication coming
                    from
                    the number of active monthly players on the hit game Minecraft. (data sourced from
                    https://www.statista.com/statistics/680139/minecraft-active-players-worldwide/.) Since June of
                    2016, the number of active monthly players has risen from 40 million worldwide to a staggering 141
                    million.

                    <p>Video games can be enjoyed at any time of day (or night.) The best time to play is all up to each
                        indivudal's free time. Personally, I like to play in the afternoon and evening, after I have
                        completed my homework for the day.

                        preferences. A mobile gamer or a Nintendo Switch user can play in their house, outside, on a
                        plane, etc. The sky is the limit for them. Individuals who use desktop computers, may have a
                        harder time, as these devices are quite heavy. They may be limited to a single space, such as
                        their bedroom or living room.

                    <p>Whatever the reason may be, it is evident with Steam users that Video Games provide enjoyment for
                        people that is hard to replicate anywhere else. In the year of 2020 alone, Steam a computer game
                        store application, saw 62.6 million daily active players. This is an incomprehensible amount.
