                    never tiring. This site will provide a brief overview on my hobby of video games.

            <article>
                <p>Video games are a very popular passtime for many people accross the world. Video games come in all
                    shapes and
                    sizes, ranging from consoles, to mobile devices, to laptops, to desktops. I find them to be
                    extremely enjoyable and a great way to spend my time
                    when I have little else to do or work on. I have spent a lot of my life enjoying video games, and
                    hope to continue to do so!

                <p>It is clear that video games as a hobby are becoming more and more popular with one indication coming
                    from
                    the number of active monthly players on the hit game Minecraft. (data sourced from
                    https://www.statista.com/statistics/680139/minecraft-active-players-worldwide/.) Since June of
                    2016, the number of active monthly players has risen from 40 million worldwide to a staggering 141
                    million.

                    <p>Video games can be enjoyed at any time of day (or night.) The best time to play is all up to each
                        indivudal's free time. Personally, I like to play in the afternoon and evening, after I have
                        completed my homework for the day.

                        preferences. A mobile gamer or a Nintendo Switch user can play in their house, outside, on a
                        plane, etc. The sky is the limit for them. Individuals who use desktop computers, may have a
                        harder time, as these devices are quite heavy. They may be limited to a single space, such as
                        their bedroom or living room.
