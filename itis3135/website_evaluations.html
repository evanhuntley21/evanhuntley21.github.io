            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net">Bad Website</a></h3>
            <div>
            <p>In all my years of looking at websites, arngren.net is the worst one I have ever seen. 
                It is supposed to be a site that sells elctronics, gadgets, and vehicles. It is jumbled, terrible to look at, and it outright confusing. 
                It is very evident that the people designing the website paid no regard to the design principles of C.R.A.P.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>C: Contrast</li>
                    <li>R: Repetition</li>
                    <li>A: Alignment</li>
                    <li>P: Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This website fails at every single principle. The contrast between the colors of the text, boxes and dividers gives me a headache.
                    The style of the page is all over the place, with no styles repeating themselves, but instead there is just incoherent nonsense.
                    There is no sense of alignment on this website as everything is just thrown on the page.
                    There is no collection of ideas of similar items, with all of the things for sale not grouped together at all. Everything is jammed together.
                </p>
                </div>
            </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://playbook.com">Good Website</a></h3>
            <div>
            <p>The site I chose for my good website is playbook.com, a website selling a creative collaborative space for visual projects.
            This website stood out to me right away in how well it followed all of the four principles of C.R.A.P.
            
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>C: Contrast</li>
                    <li>R: Repetition</li>
                    <li>A: Alignment</li>
                    <li>P: Proximity</li>
                </ul>
            <p>This website excels at every single principle. 
                The colors of the background, images, text boxes, and text stand out, but blend very nicely together and are not overwhelming.
                The style of the page differs slighly in different parts of the page, but it is clear what ideas and items are similar due to their similar formatting.
                The alignment of items is very well done and there is a clear separation of information.
                All of the ideas that are similar to eachother are in relatively close proximity to eachother, making the page flow nicely.
