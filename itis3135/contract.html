            <p>
                I, Evan A, Huntley agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2023, ITIS3135 with
                my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
                and
                will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As
                such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples
                online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
                and
                will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and
                never
                from my classmates.
                Signed: Evan A, Huntley , 06/03/2023
